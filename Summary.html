        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>I found the video summary portion of this course to be the most suprizingly enjoyable. I thought I would've had a harder timenever using a video editing software but the layout, functionality, and workflow were surpzingly intitutive and managable. I actually ended up enjoying this section much more than I would've ever realized had I not taken this course.</p>
