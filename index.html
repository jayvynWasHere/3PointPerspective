        <h2>Summary of My Experience</h2>
        <p> This is a story of the time i took DIG200 as summer class. As a more liberal arts focused major the only time I took a class closely related to digital applications was computer science in highschool. sadly I dont rememebr most of what was learned during that class so i was expecting to appraoch every assignment in DIG2000 as a newcomer. During the course I had the opprotunity to learn and develop my digital media comptence and skills through producing various forms of contnet within various mediums. </p>
