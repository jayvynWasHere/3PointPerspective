        <h2>Summary of My Experience</h2>
        <p>This is a story of the time I took DIG200 as a summer class. As a more liberal arts-focused major, the only time I took a class closely related to digital applications was computer science in high school. Sadly, I don't remember most of what was learned during that class, so I was expecting to approach every assignment in DIG2000 as a newcomer. During the course, I had the opportunity to learn and develop my digital media competence and skills through producing various forms of content within various mediums.</p>
